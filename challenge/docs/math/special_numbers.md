**Special Types of Numbers in Mathematics**

In mathematics, numbers come in many different types, each with its own unique properties and uses. While most people are familiar with whole numbers and fractions, there are several *special types of numbers* that play a critical role in both basic and advanced math.

1. **Prime Numbers**
   A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Examples include 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. Primes are often called the "building blocks" of all numbers because every whole number can be expressed as a product of primes.

2. **Perfect Numbers**
   A perfect number is a number that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). For example, 6 is perfect because its divisors 1, 2, and 3 add up to 6. These numbers are rare and have fascinated mathematicians since ancient times.

3. **Square and Cube Numbers**
   Square numbers are the product of a number multiplied by itself (e.g., 4, 9, 16), while cube numbers result from a number multiplied by itself twice (e.g., 8, 27, 64). These numbers appear often in geometry and algebra.

4. **Fibonacci Numbers**
   The Fibonacci sequence begins with 0 and 1, and each new number is the sum of the two before it: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on. This sequence shows up in nature, art, and computer science.

5. **Irrational Numbers**
   Irrational numbers cannot be written as a simple fraction. They have non-repeating, non-terminating decimal expansions. Famous examples include π (pi) and √2.

6. **Imaginary and Complex Numbers**
   Imaginary numbers are based on the square root of –1, written as **i**. When combined with real numbers, they form complex numbers (like 3 + 2i), which are essential in advanced mathematics, especially in engineering and physics.

These special numbers extend our understanding of math far beyond counting and arithmetic. They help describe patterns, solve equations, and even model real-world phenomena.
