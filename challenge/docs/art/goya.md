**Francisco Goya: The Dark Genius of Spanish Art**

Francisco de Goya y Lucientes (1746–1828) was one of Spain’s most influential and enigmatic artists. Born in Fuendetodos, Spain, Goya rose from humble beginnings to become the court painter to the Spanish Crown. His work spanned a transformative period in European history, capturing the elegance of the Enlightenment and the horror of war with unflinching honesty.

In his early career, Goya was known for his cheerful and vibrant paintings, including elegant portraits of Spanish aristocracy and tapestry designs for the Royal Palace. However, as Spain was plunged into turmoil during the Napoleonic Wars, Goya’s art took a darker turn.

His series **"The Disasters of War"** (1810–1820) offered a raw, unsentimental portrayal of the violence and suffering inflicted during the Peninsular War. These etchings, never published in his lifetime, revealed a deep disillusionment with both war and politics.

Later in life, Goya created the haunting **"Black Paintings"**—a series of nightmarish murals painted directly onto the walls of his home. Works like **"Saturn Devouring His Son"** reflect his descent into personal despair, possibly exacerbated by illness and deafness, and his growing cynicism toward humanity.

Goya is often called the bridge between the Old Masters and modern art. His bold techniques, psychological depth, and unfiltered view of reality influenced countless artists, from Édouard Manet to Pablo Picasso.
