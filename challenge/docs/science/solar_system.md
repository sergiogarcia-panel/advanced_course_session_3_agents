**The Solar System: Our Cosmic Neighborhood**

The Solar System is the collection of planets, moons, and other celestial objects that orbit our star—the Sun. Formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a giant cloud of gas and dust, the Solar System is our home in the vast universe.

At the center is the **Sun**, a massive ball of hot gas that provides the heat and light necessary for life on Earth. Its gravity keeps all other objects in orbit around it.

There are **eight planets** in the Solar System, divided into two main groups:

1. **Terrestrial Planets** – These are small, rocky planets close to the Sun:

   * **Mercury** – the smallest and closest to the Sun.
   * **Venus** – similar in size to Earth but extremely hot.
   * **Earth** – the only planet known to support life.
   * **Mars** – the “Red Planet,” with evidence of past water.

2. **Gas Giants and Ice Giants** – These are much larger and farther from the Sun:

   * **Jupiter** – the largest planet, with dozens of moons and a famous Great Red Spot.
   * **Saturn** – known for its spectacular rings.
   * **Uranus** – an icy planet that rotates on its side.
   * **Neptune** – cold, blue, and the farthest known planet.

Beyond Neptune lies the **Kuiper Belt**, a region of icy bodies, including **Pluto**, which was once considered the ninth planet but is now classified as a **dwarf planet**. Other dwarf planets include Eris, Haumea, and Makemake.

The Solar System also contains **moons**, **asteroids**, **comets**, and **meteoroids**, each with unique roles and characteristics. For example, Earth’s Moon affects tides, while comets—icy bodies with glowing tails—travel in long orbits around the Sun.

Exploring the Solar System helps scientists understand not only our own planet but also the potential for life elsewhere. Robotic missions, telescopes, and space probes continue to uncover its mysteries, expanding our knowledge of the universe.
