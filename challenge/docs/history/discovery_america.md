**The Discovery of America**

The "discovery of America" refers to the moment when European explorers first arrived in the Americas, marking a turning point in world history. Although indigenous peoples had lived across the continents for thousands of years, it was the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492 that began a new era of global contact.

Columbus, an Italian navigator sailing under the Spanish flag, set out to find a westward sea route to Asia. On October 12, 1492, he landed on an island in the Caribbean, believing he had reached the Indies. Instead, he had arrived in what would later be called the **New World**—territory unknown to Europeans at the time.

Though Columbus never reached mainland North America on his first voyage, his journeys opened the door to further exploration and colonization. Over the following decades, explorers like Amerigo Vespucci, Hernán Cortés, and Francisco Pizarro traveled across the continents, encountering vast civilizations such as the Aztec and Inca Empires.

The "discovery" had profound consequences. For Europe, it meant access to new lands, wealth, and power. For the indigenous peoples of the Americas, however, it brought disease, warfare, and colonization, leading to enormous loss of life and cultural disruption.

Today, historians recognize that America was not "discovered" in the literal sense—it was already home to millions. Instead, the arrival of Europeans in 1492 marks the beginning of a long and complex history of interaction between continents and cultures that continues to shape the world.
