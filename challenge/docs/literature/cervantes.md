**Miguel de Cervantes: The Father of the Modern Novel**

Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra (1547–1616) is widely regarded as one of the greatest writers in the Spanish language and a foundational figure in Western literature. He is best known as the author of *Don Quixote*, a groundbreaking work that is often considered the first modern novel.

Born in Alcalá de Henares, Spain, Cervantes led a life filled with adventure and hardship. He fought in the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, where he was wounded and lost the use of his left hand. Later, he was captured by pirates and spent five years as a slave in Algiers before being ransomed and returning to Spain.

Cervantes struggled financially for most of his life, working as a tax collector and a government official, yet he never stopped writing. In 1605, he published **"The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha"**, the story of a deluded nobleman who sets out to revive chivalry, imagining himself a knight in a world that no longer values such ideals. Accompanied by his practical squire, Sancho Panza, Don Quixote becomes both a tragic and comedic figure, symbolizing the clash between dreams and reality.

The novel was an instant success and became one of the most translated and influential books in the world. Its rich characters, satirical tone, and complex structure revolutionized storytelling, laying the groundwork for modern fiction.

Cervantes continued to write until his death in 1616—the same year as William Shakespeare, with whom he is often compared. Despite his struggles, Cervantes left behind a legacy that transformed literature and gave voice to the power of imagination.
